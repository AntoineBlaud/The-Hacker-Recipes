Cheatsheets are huge resources, but they sometimes lack simplicity or on the contrary they don't give any context or explanation. **This is not a cheatsheets project**. Everything here will be verified, tested, and not only copy-pasted from I don't know where.

Keep in mind that these guides are maintained by non-omniscient security enthusiasts in their spare time. You will probably find things missing or mistakes and writing all this takes time.
